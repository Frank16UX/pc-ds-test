## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- **Primary**: For the main call-to-action on a page or section
- **Secondary**: For important but not primary actions
- **Tertiary**: For less prominent actions that don't require button emphasis
- **Destructive**: For dangerous actions that require extra caution

### Best Practices
1. Use only one primary button per section to maintain clear hierarchy
2. Label buttons with clear, action-oriented text
3. Keep button text concise (1-3 words when possible)
4. Use consistent button placement across your application
5. Ensure sufficient spacing between buttons
6. Use icons to enhance clarity, not as the sole indicator
