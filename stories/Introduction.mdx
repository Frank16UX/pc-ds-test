# Welcome to the Pampered Chef Design System

This Storybook highlights the token layers that power the product design system. Use the navigation on the left to explore the available primitives and semantic tokens.

## What you will find

- **Primitives** – raw color scales, spacing steps, and other building blocks that remain brand agnostic.
- **Tokens** – semantic color assignments for text, surfaces, borders, buttons, and more.
- **Typography** – responsive desktop and mobile type scales built from Questa and Lexend.
- **Motion** – durations, delays, and easing curves for consistent interactions.
- **Layout utilities** – breakpoints, container widths, aspect ratios, and z-index tiers.
- **Elevation** – layered shadow sets for depth treatments.

## Using these stories

Each story surfaces:

1. The token name and CSS variable.
2. A live visualization or demo.
3. Guidance on when to apply the token.

Need a quick reference? Bookmark the stories that you use most often. When new tokens land, they will appear under the same "Foundations" group.

If you notice a token mismatch or would like additional coverage, open an issue in the design system repository. Continuous feedback keeps this catalog accurate and actionable for designers and engineers alike.
